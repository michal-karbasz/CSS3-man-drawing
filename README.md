# CSS Man Drawing

An image made exclusively in CSS. I've started this project to build up my 'drawing' skills. 
There are some simple eye, mouth animations but more can be added if necessary.  

<img src=man.png />

* Yes, I know about hair 1 pixel gap - I first wanted to correct that
but as I permanently gained some grey hairs while working on this image
I've decided to keep it eventually.
